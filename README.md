Buffer calculator which uses Tkinter as a UI. Very basic.
Input is a list of buffer components and their desired concentrations and a final volume of the buffer.
Output is a list of weights of each component need to achieve the desired concentration.

Comes with a small library of standard buffer components found in reagent_lib.txt. 
This library can be added to locally once the project is downloaded.
